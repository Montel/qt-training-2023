# Building a Qt (QML) GUI with Rust

In this tutorial you'll get familiar with:

- Setting up the Rust build system to link with Qt
- Starting a Qt/QML application from Rust
- Creating QObjects in Rust and using them in your QML GUI

We will create a small GUI that can load an image, apply a filter to it and display the result.

The result will look something like this:
